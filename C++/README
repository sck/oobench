1  Running C++ Benchmarks: Recommended Prerequisites
====================================================

GCC
===

All the benchmarks were developed to at least work with GCC-2.95.2, and
GCC-3.0.2.  GCC is available at http://www.gcc.org/.

2  Coding Conventions
=====================

Coding conventions are oriented on the conventions described in the
Stroustrup book, except the ones that the author disliked, namely:
instead of using underscores to separate words of names, the first
letters are capitalized (like done in Java), the same applies to template
arguments, that are usually named more verbosely than in the Stroustrup
book, to get a better grasp of their meaning.

A  C++ Resources
================

The following books/resources were used during writing of the benchmarks:

    "The C++ Programming Language", by Bjarne Stroustrup;
    "Guru of the Week", by Herb Sutter, http://www.gotw.ca/.
