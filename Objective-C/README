1  Running Objective-C Benchmarks: Recommended Prerequisites
============================================================

Foundation Library
==================

As Foundation library, libFoundation is recommended, available from 
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libFoundation/; recommended version
is 0.9.0.

Note for SuSE-7.2: When making libFoundation, it needed to be compiled as
a static library, otherwise there where linking errors during compilation
of Objective-C programs that used libFoundation.

2  Coding Conventions
=====================

Coding conventions used for the benchmarks are based on the example code
in the Cox book, and the libFoundation's source code.

A  Objective-C Resources
========================

The following books/resources were used during writing of the benchmarks:

    "Object-Oriented Programming--An Evolutionary Approach", by Brad Cox;
    "The Foundation Framework", by Apple Computer, Inc.,
        http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/ObjC_classic/IntroFoundation.html;
    "NEXTSTEP OOP-Manual", by NeXT.
