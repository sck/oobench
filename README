OO Bench README
================

WHAT IS IT?
===========

Compares the speed of the same object-oriented tasks in several
object-oriented languages.

AIMS
====

- Simple, easy to understand, and easy to port.
- Follow the idioms and best practices advised by each language as much
  as possible.
- Easy to look up how a particular problem is best solved in another
  language.

REMARKS 
=======

- Currently focus is on source code rather than on benchmark results,
  since reviews of the benchmarks are yet due.
