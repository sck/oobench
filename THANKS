* Many thanks go out to Armin Roehrl <armin@approximity.com>, who gave me
  the opportunity to use his home Linux box, donated the resources for
  OO Bench's daily build environment, motivation, and many other things.

* Also many thanks to the IRC channels #c++, and #java.de on IRCNET, who
  inspired me, and answered many of the questions that I had during
  the development of OO Bench (You know who you are).
